Welcome to the Mağara codebase. Let's build something awesome for students.

## What is Mağara?

Mağara is a platform where college and university students can find
accommodation with ease. Mağara's key difference from other housing applications
is the ability for tertiary institutions to install a local and customized
instance on their servers. This saves institutions from paying exorbitant
installation, maintenance and uninstall fees.

## Codebase

### The stack

Mağara runs top of [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org), and it does not
have JavaScript on the frontend. It uses jQuery, Popper.js for Bootstrap.
